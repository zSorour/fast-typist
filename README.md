## Introduction

Fast Typist is a browser-based typing game that allows you to practice your typing skills and type in a set of given words correctly where there is a time limit for each word. The game can be played in a Single Player mode where you do your best to keep improving and getting a personal top score with a scoreboard feature that combines personal top scores across the world. In the future, a Multiplayer game mode will be developed that enables a player to create a room and compete against one of their friends live.
